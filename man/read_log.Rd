\usage{
read_log(file, col_names = FALSE, col_types = NULL, skip = 0,
  n_max = -1, progress = interactive())
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
   (either a single string or a raw vector).

   Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
   be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \code{http://},
   \code{https://}, \code{ftp://}, or \code{ftps://} will be automatically
   downloaded.

   Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at
   least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path).}

\item{col_names}{Either \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE} or a character vector
  of column names.

  If \code{TRUE}, the first row of the input will be used as the column
  names, and will not be included in the data frame. If \code{FALSE}, column
  names will be generated automatically: X1, X2, X3 etc.

  If \code{col_names} is a character vector, the values will be used as the
  names of the columns, and the first row of the input will be read into
  the first row of the output data frame.}

\item{col_types}{One of \code{NULL}, a list, a named list or a string.
  See \code{vignette("column-types")} for more details.

  If \code{NULL}, the column type will be imputed from the first 1000 rows
  on the input. This is convenient (and fast), but not robust. If the
  imputation fails, you'll need to supply the correct types yourself.

  If a list, it must contain one "\code{\link{collector}}" for each column.
  If you only want to read a subset of the columns, you can use a named list
  (where the names give the column names). If a column is not mentioned by
  name, it will be parsed with the default collector (as determined by
  reading the first 1000 rows).

  Alternatively, you can use a compact string representation where each
  character represents one column: c = character, d = double, i = integer,
  l = logical, ? = guess, or \code{_}/\code{-} to skip the column.

  To select a subset of columns, and set the types, by regular expressions
  you may pass a list with two elements and \code{attr(., 'regex') == TRUE},
  or use the function \code{col_regex_type()} to generate said list.
  The first element of the list is a character vector or regular expressions,
  the second element is a character vector of "l", "d", "i", etc. to denote
  the data type of the columns.}

\item{skip}{Number of lines to skip before reading data.}

\item{n_max}{Maximum number of records to read.}

\item{progress}{Display a progress bar? By default it will only display
in an interactive session. The display is updated every 50,000 values
and will only display if estimated reading time is 5 seconds or more.}

\description{
This is a fairly standard format for log files - it uses both quotes
and square brackets for quoting, and there may be literal quotes embedded
in a quoted string. The dash, "-", is used for missing values.
